## Hi, I'm Hema!  
Welcome to my coding world, where some days my GitHub calendar is a field of gray squares (the official color of “absolutely nothing happening”).  
Other days, those little squares turn green—sometimes pale, sometimes deep—depending on whether I’m feeling productive or just hitting “commit” for the thrill of it.
